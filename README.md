## 1 DTMF(Dual tone multi frequency) decoder

Dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) is a method used to dial telephone numbers or to issue commands to switching systems. DTMF is widely used for telecommunication signaling between telephone handsets and switching centers over analog telephone lines in voice-frequency bands. 

DTMF is used in push-button telephones for tone dialing. This version of DTMF is an AT&T registered trademark and is called Touch-Tone.
